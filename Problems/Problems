PROBLEM NAME | PROBLEM ID | PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------
Physical Barriers to Properties | P001 | Hostile architecture, gentrification, and privatization of public spaces prevent the homeless from accessing basic shelter or communal spaces,
Criminalization of Homelessness | P002 | Laws that criminalize survival activities like sleeping, camping, and panhandling make it nearly impossible for homeless individuals to exist in public without breaking the law,  
Strict Zoning Laws | P003 | Zoning regulations prevent the creation of alternative housing solutions, such as communal housing, tiny homes, or squatter settlements, reinforcing private property norms,  
Anti-Squatting Legislation | P004 | Laws against squatting prioritize the protection of vacant properties over the basic human need for shelter, further marginalizing the homeless,
Encampment Sweeps | P005 | State and city governments frequently destroy homeless encampments, displacing individuals without providing viable housing alternatives,
Fear of Arrest or Harassment | P006 | Homeless people live in constant fear of police harassment, arrest, or violence, making it dangerous to occupy public or private spaces, 
Internalized Shame and Stigmatization | P007 | The stigma associated with homelessness creates psychological barriers to accessing space, as homeless individuals internalize societal judgment and alienation,  
Real Estate Speculation | P008 | Real estate developers keep properties vacant for speculative profit rather than allowing them to be used to house homeless individuals,
Government-Real Estate Collusion | P009 | Local governments prioritize the interests of real estate developers, providing tax breaks and subsidies that perpetuate housing inequality,  
Militarized Policing of Public Spaces | P010 | Police and private security forces collaborate with real estate interests to remove homeless individuals from public spaces and prevent squatting, 
Inadequate Public Housing | P011 | Chronic underfunding and bureaucratic delays leave many homeless individuals on waiting lists for public housing with no immediate solution,
Neglect of Affordable Housing | P012 | The government focuses on luxury and market-rate developments instead of building genuinely affordable housing for low-income residents,  
Neoliberal Housing Policies | P013 | Government reliance on private market solutions like tax credits fails to address the root causes of homelessness and housing insecurity, 
Suppression of Collective Housing Models | P014 | Legal and regulatory barriers prevent the development of cooperative housing models or community land trusts, favoring privatized housing markets, 
Surveillance and Policing of Public Spaces | P015 | Increasing state surveillance and policing of public areas, disproportionately targeting homeless populations and restricting access,  
Nonprofit Industrial Complex | P016 | Large nonprofit organizations funded by the state often provide temporary relief without challenging the systemic causes of homelessness,
