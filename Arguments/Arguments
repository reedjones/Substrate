ARGUMENT | A001 | Homelessness is the result of systemic inequality and a failure to prioritize housing as a human right, not individual moral failings.  
ARGUMENT | A002 | Private property laws and the commodification of housing create artificial scarcity, driving up costs and leaving many without access to shelter.  
ARGUMENT | A003 | Cooperative housing models are more democratic and equitable than capitalist, for-profit housing systems that prioritize profits over people.  
ARGUMENT | A004 | Sweeps and the destruction of homeless encampments are violent state actions that further marginalize and harm vulnerable populations.  
ARGUMENT | A005 | Real estate speculation should be heavily regulated, as it is incompatible with the right to housing for all people.  
ARGUMENT | A006 | The criminalization of homelessness disproportionately affects marginalized groups, including people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those with disabilities.  
ARGUMENT | A007 | Collective action and mutual aid are the most effective ways to combat homelessness, as top-down government solutions often fail to address the root causes.
