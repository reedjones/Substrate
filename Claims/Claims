CLAIM | C001 | Housing is a basic human right, and the criminalization of homelessness is a violation of this fundamental right.  
CLAIM | C002 | Property speculation and government collusion with developers prioritize profit over people, reinforcing economic inequality and housing insecurity.  
CLAIM | C003 | Sweeps and forced displacement violate the dignity of homeless individuals and should be replaced with solutions that prioritize their safety and autonomy.  
CLAIM | C004 | Current housing policies are driven by neoliberal market logic, which will never solve the crisis of homelessness because they ignore the structural causes of poverty.  
CLAIM | C005 | Real estate development without community input or oversight only serves to further displace the most vulnerable populations.  
CLAIM | C006 | A system that relies on policing homelessness to solve housing issues only exacerbates the problem and leads to cycles of violence and incarceration.  
CLAIM | C007 | Collective housing models and non-hierarchical solutions can provide more equitable, stable housing outcomes than privatized, for-profit housing models.
